Functions for Community Data and Ordinations

A collection of small functions useful in (vegetation) community analyses and ordinations, mainly to facilitate plotting and interpretation. The ordination functions work as add-on for functions from vegan-package. 

Includes automatic selection of species for ordination diagrams (ordiselect()-function), species reponse curves (specresponse()-function), rank-abundance curves (racurve()-function) and stress plots/scree plots for NMDS (dimcheckMDS()-function).
